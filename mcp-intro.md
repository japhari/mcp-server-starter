# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Introduction

## Importance of MCP

The AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems becoming more capable. However, these models are often limited by their training data and lack access to real-time information or specialized tools. This limits their ability to provide relevant, accurate, and helpful responses in many scenarios.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by enabling AI models to connect with external data sources, tools, and environments. MCP allows seamless transfer of information and capabilities between AI systems and the broader digital world, making interoperability possible and practical for real-world AI applications.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a standard protocol for connecting AI applications to external tools and data sources. It is often described as the “USB-C for AI applications,” providing a consistent interface for linking AI models to external capabilities. This standardization benefits users, developers, and the broader ecosystem by reducing integration complexity and increasing interoperability.

## The Integration Problem

Without MCP, connecting M different AI applications to N different tools or data sources requires M×N custom integrations. This is complex, expensive, and hard to maintain. MCP transforms this into an M+N problem: each AI application implements the client side of MCP once, and each tool/data source implements the server side once. This dramatically reduces integration complexity.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Host**: The user-facing AI application (e.g., Claude Desktop, AI IDEs, custom agents).
- **Client**: The component within the host that manages communication with a specific MCP Server.
- **Server**: An external program or service that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) via MCP.

### Capabilities

- **Tools**: Executable functions the AI model can invoke (e.g., get weather for a location).
- **Resources**: Read-only data sources providing context (e.g., scientific papers).
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates or workflows guiding interactions (e.g., summarization prompt).
- **Sampling**: Server-initiated requests for the client/host to perform LLM interactions, enabling recursive actions.

## MCP Architecture

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

- The **Host** manages user interactions and orchestrates the flow between user requests, LLM processing, and external tools.
- The **Client** handles protocol-level communication with a single server.
- The **Server** exposes capabilities in a standardized format for clients to discover and use.

### Communication Flow

1. User interacts with the Host.
2. Host processes input and determines which capabilities are needed.
3. Client connects to the appropriate Server(s).
4. Client discovers available capabilities.
5. Host instructs Client to invoke specific capabilities.
6. Server executes and returns results.
7. Client relays results to Host for integration and presentation.

This modularity allows a single Host to connect to multiple Servers, and new Servers can be added without changing existing Hosts. This design transforms the M×N integration problem into a manageable M+N problem.

## Principles of MCP

- **Standardization**: Universal protocol for AI connectivity.
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward core protocol with support for advanced features.
- **Safety**: Explicit user approval for sensitive operations.
- **Discoverability**: Dynamic discovery of capabilities.
- **Extensibility**: Supports evolution through versioning and negotiation.
- **Interoperability**: Works across different implementations and environments.

# MCP Clients: The Bridge Between AI and Tools

## Overview

In the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem, the **Client** plays a pivotal role. It acts as a bridge between an AI application (called the **Host**) and external services (called **Servers**) that provide capabilities such as tools, resources, prompts, and sampling.

This section will guide you through:

- What MCP Clients are and their purpose
- How to configure MCP Clients for both local and remote use
- Real-world client implementations in chat interfaces, IDEs, and code agents
- Hands-on examples using `smolagents` and Hugging Face MCP-compatible servers

## 1. What is an MCP Client?

An **MCP Client** is a component within a Host (like an AI assistant or smart IDE) that manages communication with one or more MCP Servers.

### Key Responsibilities:

- Connect to MCP Servers using defined transport (e.g., `stdio`, `sse`)
- Discover and list available capabilities
- Send requests and receive results from MCP Servers
- Relay data between LLMs and external tools or data

Think of it as the "network card" of your AI application—it translates and channels intent into action.

## 2. Examples of MCP Clients in Action

### A. Chat Interfaces

- **Claude Desktop (Anthropic)** – Integrates with multiple MCP Servers, exposing capabilities through natural language chat.

### B. Developer Tools

- **Cursor IDE** – Embedded MCP Client supports tool invocation for AI-powered code writing.
- **Continue.dev (VS Code)** – A popular open-source plugin that allows AI-driven development via MCP integrations.

## 3. Configuring MCP Clients

Configuration is typically done via a standardized JSON file: `mcp.json`.

### A. Base Structure

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Server Name",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio" | "sse"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### B. Local Server with `stdio` Transport

Launches a local script as a server:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "File Explorer",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["/path/to/file_explorer_server.py"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### C. Remote Server with `HTTP + SSE` Transport

Connects to a web-accessible server:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Weather API",
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://example.com/mcp-server"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### D. Using Environment Variables

To securely pass credentials or config values:

```python
# In your server script
import os
token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
```

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "GitHub API",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["/path/to/github_server.py"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Coding with MCP Clients

You can use the MCP Client directly within code to integrate tools into intelligent agents.

### A. Using `smolagents` with Local Server

```python
from smolagents import ToolCollection
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(command="uv", args=["run", "server.py"])

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    for tool in tools.tools:
        print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}")
```

---

### B. Connecting to a Remote MCP Server

```python
from smolagents.mcp_client import MCPClient

with MCPClient({"url": "https://abidlabs-mcp-tools.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse"}) as tools:
    for t in tools:
        print(f"{t.name}: {t.description}")
```

---

### C. Using Tools in a Code Agent

```python
from smolagents import InferenceClientModel, CodeAgent, ToolCollection
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

model = InferenceClientModel()
server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(command="uv", args=["run", "server.py"])

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    agent = CodeAgent(tools=[*tools.tools], model=model)
    agent.run("What's the weather in Tokyo?")
```

---

### D. Connecting to a Packaged MCP Tool (e.g. pubmedmcp)

```python
import os
from smolagents import ToolCollection, CodeAgent
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=["--quiet", "pubmedmcp@0.1.3"],
    env={"UV_PYTHON": "3.12", **os.environ},
)

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    agent = CodeAgent(tools=[*tools.tools], add_base_tools=True)
    agent.run("Please find a remedy for hangover.")
```
