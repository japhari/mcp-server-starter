## 1. Why MCP Matters

As AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), grow more powerful, a critical limitation persists: isolation. These models are constrained by their training data and often lack direct access to real-time tools, APIs, or external knowledge bases.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** addresses this limitation by establishing a standardized way for AI systems to interface with external tools and data sources. Much like USB-C revolutionized hardware connectivity, MCP aims to do the same for AI systems—enabling interoperability, reducing integration complexity, and unlocking more intelligent, real-world applications.

## 2. What You’ll Learn

This unit introduces the foundational concepts of MCP:

- **What is MCP?** – Definition and role in the AI stack
- **Core Concepts** – The terminology and abstractions used in MCP
- **The Integration Challenge** – The M×N problem and MCP’s M+N solution
- **MCP Benefits** – Standardization, extensibility, and AI capability enhancement
- **Example Use Case** – How MCP enables practical integrations

---

## 3. Understanding the Integration Problem

### The M×N Problem

Without a standard like MCP, integrating M AI applications with N tools requires building M×N custom connectors. This leads to:

- High development and maintenance overhead
- Redundant work for each integration
- A fragmented ecosystem

### The M+N Solution

MCP simplifies integration by introducing a shared protocol. Each:

- **AI Host** implements the **MCP Client** once
- **Tool or Data Source** implements the **MCP Server** once

Result: only **M + N** integrations are needed. This modular architecture streamlines connectivity and fosters ecosystem growth.

## 4. Key Concepts & Terminology

### Components

| Term       | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Host**   | The AI application users interact with (e.g., ChatGPT, IDEs like Cursor) |
| **Client** | A component in the Host that connects to an MCP Server                   |
| **Server** | A service exposing tools, data, or prompts to the AI via MCP             |

> Note: The Client is part of the Host, handling communication with one Server.

### Capabilities

MCP defines four main capability types:

| Type         | Description                   | Example                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Tool**     | Executable functions          | `get_weather(location)`   |
| **Resource** | Read-only data                | Scientific paper database |
| **Prompt**   | Predefined LLM prompts        | Summarization templates   |
| **Sampling** | LLM-triggered recursive calls | Code review workflow      |

This structure allows AI models to execute actions, fetch data, and interact using standardized templates.

---

## 5. MCP Architecture

MCP adopts a **client-server architecture** with clearly separated responsibilities:

### Host

- Presents the user interface
- Determines what capabilities to use
- Connects via Clients to MCP Servers
- Renders results from external tools

### Client

- Manages a 1:1 connection with one MCP Server
- Handles protocol messaging
- Acts as a bridge between Host logic and Server responses

### Server

- Exposes capabilities in a standardized format
- Provides access to tools or data
- Can run locally or remotely

---

## 6. How MCP Works – Communication Flow

1. **User Input**: A user interacts with the Host (e.g., asks a question).
2. **Intent Processing**: The Host uses LLMs to understand the request.
3. **Client Activation**: The Host's Client connects to the appropriate MCP Server.
4. **Discovery**: The Client queries the Server for available capabilities.
5. **Invocation**: The Host selects and invokes the needed capability.
6. **Execution**: The Server processes the request and returns results.
7. **Response Rendering**: The Host presents the results to the user.

This pipeline enables scalable, context-aware AI behavior with external support.

---

## 7. Design Principles

MCP’s design is guided by the following principles:

- **Standardization**: A unified protocol for all AI-tool interactions
- **Simplicity**: Minimal overhead with powerful abstractions
- **Safety**: Explicit permissioning for sensitive operations
- **Discoverability**: Dynamic capability discovery at runtime
- **Extensibility**: Versioning and modular growth
- **Interoperability**: Cross-platform, cross-vendor compatibility

# Model Context Protocol (MCP): Communication Protocol Deep Dive

## Introduction

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** defines how AI applications (Clients) and external tools or services (Servers) communicate. This standard protocol ensures consistency, predictability, and interoperability across a diverse AI ecosystem. While developers don’t need to master every detail to use MCP effectively, understanding the foundation helps with debugging, implementation, and design.

---

## 1. Communication Format: JSON-RPC 2.0

MCP is built on **JSON-RPC 2.0**, a lightweight, language-agnostic protocol for remote procedure calls. JSON-RPC is used because it’s:

- Human-readable
- Simple to implement across languages
- Widely adopted with well-documented standards

### Message Types

MCP supports three primary JSON-RPC message types:

#### 1. Request (Client → Server)

Used to initiate operations.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "San Francisco"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Response (Server → Client)

Returned in reply to a request. Includes either a `result` or an `error`.

**Success:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "temperature": 62,
    "conditions": "Partly cloudy"
  }
}
```

**Error:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid location parameter"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Notification (One-way)

No `id` field and does not expect a response.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "progress",
  "params": {
    "message": "Processing data...",
    "percent": 50
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Transport Mechanisms

While JSON-RPC defines the message structure, **MCP specifies how messages are transmitted**:

### A. Standard Input/Output (stdio)

- Used when Client and Server run on the same machine.
- The Host launches the Server as a subprocess and communicates via stdin/stdout.

**Advantages**:

- Simple and secure
- No network setup required
- Suitable for local tools (e.g., file access, local scripts)

### B. HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events)

- Used when Client and Server are on different machines.
- Communication uses HTTP for requests and SSE for real-time Server → Client updates.

**Advantages**:

- Works over the network
- Supports serverless environments
- Enables real-time streaming of updates

**Streamable HTTP**: Recent MCP versions allow dynamic upgrades to SSE, making communication both flexible and compatible with serverless hosting.

---

## 3. The MCP Interaction Lifecycle

MCP interactions follow a structured, four-stage lifecycle:

### 1. Initialization

- Client connects and exchanges protocol versions and capabilities.

```text
Client → initialize
Server → response
Client → initialized
```

### 2. Discovery

- Client queries the Server to discover available capabilities.

```text
Client → tools/list
Server → response
```

This is repeated for `resources/list` and `prompts/list`.

### 3. Execution

- Client invokes specific capabilities.

```text
Client → tools/call
Server → progress (optional)
Server → result
```

### 4. Termination

- Client closes the session gracefully.

```text
Client → shutdown
Server → response
Client → exit
```

---

## 4. Core Capability Types

### A. Tools (Model-controlled)

- Executable functions triggered by the LLM.
- Can have side effects (e.g., API calls, file updates).
- Require user approval due to potential risks.

**Example:**

```python
def get_weather(location: str) -> dict:
    return {
        "temperature": 72,
        "conditions": "Sunny"
    }
```

---

### B. Resources (Application-controlled)

- Read-only data (no side effects).
- Safer and used for providing context.

**Example:**

```python
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()
```

---

### C. Prompts (User-controlled)

- Predefined instruction sets or templates for guiding interactions.
- Often selected by users via a UI.

**Example:**

```python
def code_review(code: str, language: str) -> list:
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a code reviewer..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Please review:\n{code}"}
    ]
```

---

### D. Sampling (Server-initiated)

- Allows the Server to ask the Client to initiate LLM interaction.
- Enables multi-step, agent-like behaviors.

**Example:**

```python
def request_sampling(messages):
    return {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Here's a refined version based on your data..."
    }
```

**Sampling Flow:**

```text
Server → sampling/createMessage
Client → sample from LLM
Client → returns message
```

---

## 5. Discovery Protocol

Clients can dynamically adapt by querying:

- `tools/list` – Discover Tools
- `resources/list` – Discover Resources
- `prompts/list` – Discover Prompts

This dynamic approach allows flexible and extensible integration with Servers.

| Capability | Controlled By | Direction                | Side Effects | Approval Needed | Use Cases                    |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tools      | LLM           | Client → Server          | Yes          | Yes             | API calls, mutations         |
| Resources  | Host          | Client → Server          | No           | No              | Context access               |
| Prompts    | User          | Server → Client          | No           | No              | Guided workflows             |
| Sampling   | Server        | Server → Client → Server | Indirect     | Yes             | Agentic behavior, refinement |

## 9. MCP Clients: The Bridge Between AI and Tools

### Overview

In the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem, the **Client** plays a pivotal role. It acts as a bridge between an AI application (called the **Host**) and external services (called **Servers**) that provide capabilities such as tools, resources, prompts, and sampling.

This section will guide you through:

- What MCP Clients are and their purpose
- How to configure MCP Clients for both local and remote use
- Real-world client implementations in chat interfaces, IDEs, and code agents
- Hands-on examples using `smolagents` and Hugging Face MCP-compatible servers

---

## 1. What is an MCP Client?

An **MCP Client** is a component within a Host (like an AI assistant or smart IDE) that manages communication with one or more MCP Servers.

### Key Responsibilities:

- Connect to MCP Servers using defined transport (e.g., `stdio`, `sse`)
- Discover and list available capabilities
- Send requests and receive results from MCP Servers
- Relay data between LLMs and external tools or data

Think of it as the "network card" of your AI application—it translates and channels intent into action.

---

## 2. Examples of MCP Clients in Action

### A. Chat Interfaces

- **Claude Desktop (Anthropic)** – Integrates with multiple MCP Servers, exposing capabilities through natural language chat.

### B. Developer Tools

- **Cursor IDE** – Embedded MCP Client supports tool invocation for AI-powered code writing.
- **Continue.dev (VS Code)** – A popular open-source plugin that allows AI-driven development via MCP integrations.

---

## 3. Configuring MCP Clients

Configuration is typically done via a standardized JSON file: `mcp.json`.

### A. Base Structure

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Server Name",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio" | "sse"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### B. Local Server with `stdio` Transport

Launches a local script as a server:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "File Explorer",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["/path/to/file_explorer_server.py"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### C. Remote Server with `HTTP + SSE` Transport

Connects to a web-accessible server:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Weather API",
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://example.com/mcp-server"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### D. Using Environment Variables

To securely pass credentials or config values:

```python
# In your server script
import os
token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
```

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "GitHub API",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["/path/to/github_server.py"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 4. Coding with MCP Clients

You can use the MCP Client directly within code to integrate tools into intelligent agents.

### A. Using `smolagents` with Local Server

```python
from smolagents import ToolCollection
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(command="uv", args=["run", "server.py"])

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    for tool in tools.tools:
        print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}")
```

---

### B. Connecting to a Remote MCP Server

```python
from smolagents.mcp_client import MCPClient

with MCPClient({"url": "https://abidlabs-mcp-tools.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse"}) as tools:
    for t in tools:
        print(f"{t.name}: {t.description}")
```

---

### C. Using Tools in a Code Agent

```python
from smolagents import InferenceClientModel, CodeAgent, ToolCollection
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

model = InferenceClientModel()
server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(command="uv", args=["run", "server.py"])

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    agent = CodeAgent(tools=[*tools.tools], model=model)
    agent.run("What's the weather in Tokyo?")
```

---

### D. Connecting to a Packaged MCP Tool (e.g. pubmedmcp)

```python
import os
from smolagents import ToolCollection, CodeAgent
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=["--quiet", "pubmedmcp@0.1.3"],
    env={"UV_PYTHON": "3.12", **os.environ},
)

with ToolCollection.from_mcp(server_parameters, trust_remote_code=True) as tools:
    agent = CodeAgent(tools=[*tools.tools], add_base_tools=True)
    agent.run("Please find a remedy for hangover.")
```
